# csv-issue-import

Sample script to import a CSV file (assumedly from an Azure Boards export) to GitHub issues.

This script is a starting point - you'll need to update for user name mappings, your own GITHUB_TOKEN, repo name, etc.  It isn't a complex or robust solution, but it does show an approach to map into GitHub issues...
